# Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked
# by Facebook:
# Given a list of numbers, where every number shows up twice except
# for one number, find that one number.
# Example:
# Input: [4, 3, 2, 4, 1, 3, 2]
# Output: 1

# Challenge: Find a way to do this using O(1) memory.

# ^ above was the first question asked in April 2020's 30-day leetcode challenge
# solution involved using bit-wise XOR (for O(1) memory) to get the last integer.

def single_number(nums):
    pass

print(single_number([4, 3, 2, 4, 1, 3, 2]))
# 1

# Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked
# by Facebook:
# You are given a list of numbers, and a target number k. Return
# whether or not there are two numbers in the list that add up to k.
# Example:
# Given [4, 7, 1 , -3, 2] and k = 5,
# return true since 4 + 1 = 5.
# Try to do it in a single pass of the list.

def two_sum(lst, k):
    # Fill this in.
    pass

print(two_sum([4,7,1,-3,2], 5))
# True
